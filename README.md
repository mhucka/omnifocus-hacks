## Introduction

I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and have developed scripts to automate various procedures for my needs. This repository contains some of them. It's a continual work in progress.


## Installation and usage

There is no one-shot installation procedure nor a single usage procedure for all of these hacks. Please check each subdirectory separately; there is a README file that explains what needs to be done for each case.


## Known issues and limitations

The solutions and code in this repository were developed over a period of years spanning multiple releases of [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) in my sometimes idiosyncratic macOS environment. While they work for me (or did at the time I put them here), it is possible they will not work in your environment or in the version of OmniFocus that you are using.
